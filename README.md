# VibeMatcher
AI Vibe Matcher — A mini fashion recommendation system that matches outfit items to a user’s vibe query using LangChain, FAISS, and Groq LLM. It embeds product descriptions, performs semantic similarity search, and generates creative outfit suggestions based on the vibe (e.g., “energetic urban winter streetwear”).
